//Write a program to count in arbitrary base
//Ask the user for the base
//Bases from 2 to 10 should be accepted
//Count from 0 to the maximum number which can be written in 4 digits.
//Strategy:
//Use one variable to represent each digit
//Always increment the least significant digit
//Check for carrying one digit at a time (starting with the least significant digit)
//Check to see if you have gotten to the top of the count.  (A good way is to have an extra digit and see if you carry into it.)

//Write a program to print out a 1 month calendar for any month.
//The program should ask for the  month in a year (i.e. 3/2134)
//The program should check to make sure the date is valid
//The format should look like a standard calendar which shows the days of the week in 1 row and aligns the dates for each day of the week in columns.
//This is going to take a bit of work with output formatting.

int main(int argc, const char * argv[]) {
    // insert code here...
    printf("Hello, World!\n");
    return 0;
